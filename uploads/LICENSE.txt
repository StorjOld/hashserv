  single software program.) You will obtain a separate license for each
  additional user of the Software (whether or not such users are connected on a
  network). You are not permitted to sell, lease, distribute, transfer,
  sublicense, or otherwise dispose of the Software, in whole or in part, for any
  form of actual or potential commercial gain or consideration.

  potential commercial gain or consideration.
